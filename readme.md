## Usage

After signing in with Google, users can start a conversation with the AI. Each user's message is sent to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, which returns a response that is displayed on the user's screen.

The AI can simulate a 'typing' effect before it displays its message, providing a more conversational feel to the application.

Users can also adjust the AI's 'personality' using a system message that sets the tone for the AI's responses.

## File Structure

The application consists of several main components:

- `ChatAI`: The main chat interface.
- `SignIn`: Handles user authentication.
- `ConversationList`: Displays a list of all conversations.
- `ProcessMessageToChatGPT`: Processes messages and sends them to GPT-3 for response generation.
- `PersonalityOptions`: Contains options for setting the AI's 'personality'.
- `authentication.js`: Handles sign in and sign out operations.
- `firebaseConfig.js`: Contains configuration details for Firestore and Firebase Authentication.
